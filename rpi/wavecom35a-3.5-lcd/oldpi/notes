docs:

on fbcon, fbcon=map option etc:
* https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt
* control after with con2fbmap command

aha, so the trick here is to fake the pi into thinking it has hdmi, output to hdmi, then clone fb0->fb1 in userspace with fbcp, ew. But it's useful to keep the hdmi options
in config.txt because otherwise the lcd will sometimes be fb0, sometimes fb1.

(may need to change)

/etc/init.d/lightdm restart

... with which the display blanks, but doesn't do anything else, damn.


made it work with a more complex x config; may break after reboot hdmi

touchscreen rotated. Used 

	sudo DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 xinput list


pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 xinput list
⎡ Virtual core pointer                    	id=2	[master pointer  (3)]
⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer              	id=4	[slave  pointer  (2)]
⎜   ↳ ADS7846 Touchscreen                     	id=6	[slave  pointer  (2)]

then ran

	sudo DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 xinput_calibrator

to get

	Section "InputClass"
		Identifier	"calibration"
		MatchProduct	"ADS7846 Touchscreen"
		Option	"MinX"	"20980"
		Option	"MaxX"	"22437"

		Option	"InvertX"	"0"  # unless it was already set
		Option	"InvertY"	"0"  # unless it was already set

installed in config as simplified


	Section "InputClass"
		Identifier	"calibration"
		MatchProduct	"ADS7846 Touchscreen"
		Option	"SwapXY"	"1" # unless it was already set to 1
		Option	"InvertX"	"0"  # unless it was already set
		Option	"InvertY"	"0"  # unless it was already set
	EndSection

but didn't work because swapxy not working



If I want both displays to work I have to switch to using fbturbo for the driver on the little panel too,
it doesn't like sharing with fbdev.
